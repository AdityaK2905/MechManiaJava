# MechMania Java Starterpack

Welcome to MechMania! The java starterpack will allow you to write a java bot to compete against others.
Two bots will be faced against each other, and then the [engine](https://github.com/MechMania-29/engine) will run a simulation to see who wins!
After the engine runs you'll get a gamelog (a large json file) that you can use in the [visualizer](https://github.com/MechMania-29/visualizer) to
visualize the game's progress and end result.
